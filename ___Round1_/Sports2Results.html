                <li><b>We will implement your decisions in the following parts should a certain
                  match be realized during the experiment.</b></li>
                <li>Decisions made here will affect the number of hints available
                to the test-taker in later parts.</li>
                <li>For instance, if test-taker X is matched with you in one of his/her parts,
                  the hints s/he receives may be determined by the choices you are about to
                  make in this round.</li>
                <li>You will see the number of hints the test-taker took for each subject as well
                  as the questions for which they took a hint.</li>
