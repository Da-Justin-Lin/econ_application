        <ul>
          <li>In this part, you will make decisions as a helper and be matched with different test-takers</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>We will implement your decisions in the following parts
              should a certain match be realized during the experiment</b></li>
            <li>Decisions made here will affect the number of hints available
            to the test-taker in later parts.</li>
            <li>For instance, if test-taker X is matched with you in one of his/her parts,
              the hints s/he receives may be determined by the choices you are about to
              make in this part.</li>
            <li>You will see the number of hints the test-taker took for each subject as
              well as the questions for which they took a hint</li>
