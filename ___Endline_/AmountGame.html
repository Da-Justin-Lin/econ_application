    <p>We are now interested in knowing more about the way you take decisions.</p>
    <p>We will give you 100 Rs. in real money. You can choose to keep or to invest
      some or all of the money in a risky project. In your real life, this project
      could be, for instance, a friendâ€™s business opportunity, a costly training
      program, or planting some seeds in a small plot of agricultural land. Money
      that is not invested in the risky project is yours to keep. </p>
    <p>The risky project has a 50% chance of success. This means is equally likely
      to succeed as it is to fail.If the project is successful, you will receive
      3 times the amount you chose to invest. If the project is unsuccessful, you
      will lose the amount invested.</p>

    <br>

    <i><p>Example: If you invest 10 Rs. into the risky project, you will receive 30 Rs.
      back if the project is successful (with 50% chance). If the project is unsuccessful
      (with 50% chance), you will lose the whole amount you invested. In both cases,
      you will be able to keep the 90 Rs. which you did not invest in the risky project.
      Note that you will not know whether or not the project will be successful when 
      you make the decision to invest. The success of the project will only be revealed
      after your investment.</p></i>

    <br>

    <p>Please note that we will be taking this decision with real money. After you
      choose how much you would like to invest, we will use this computer to randomly
      determine, using a lottery, if the project is successful. The lottery has a
      50-50 chance, so that the project will succeed in 50 percent of cases and
      the project will fail in 50 percent of all cases. </p>
