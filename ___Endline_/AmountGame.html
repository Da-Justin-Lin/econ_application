    <p>From the Rs.300 participation payment, how much of it will you want us to use to enter you into
    a game and how much would you like to keep without any game. Once you decide on the amount you want to
    play a game with, our team will enter that amount in a computer. According to a pre-fixed criteria,
    the computer will choose a winner out of two people. If you are the winner, you will get 2.5 times
    the amount you played the game with. If you are not the winner, you will just get back the amount that
    you did not play the game with.</p>

    <br>

    <i><p>Example: Suppose from the Rs.300 participation fee you earned, you decided to play the game with
    Rs.150 of the Rs.300 and keep Rs.150. If you are picked as the winner, you will get Rs.150 (the amount
    you have kept for yourself) plus Rs.150 x 2.5 = 375 (the amount you earned in the game), for a total
    of Rs.525.</p>
    <p>If you are picked as the winner, you will lose the Rs.150 in the game but you will keep the Rs.150
    you kept for yourself</p></i>
