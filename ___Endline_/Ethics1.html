      and was found by a <u>WOMAN</u> who lives close to you and KNOWS YOU PERSONALLY.
      The wallet has a document that identifies you. How likely do you find that
      this person gives you the wallet back with the money in it?</b></p>

    <p><b>Please think about what you would do in the following situation. You are
      in an area you are not familiar with, and you realize you lost your way. You
      ask a stranger for directions. The stranger offers to take you to your destination.
      Helping you costs the stranger about 20 Rs in total. However, the stranger says
      he or she does not want any money from you. You have six presents with you.
      The cheapest present costs 5 Rs, the most expensive one costs 30 Rs. Do you
      give one of the presents to the stranger as a “thank-you”- gift? If so, which
      present do you give to the stranger?</b></p>
