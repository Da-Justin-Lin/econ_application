    <p>We will now ask you to choose repeatedly between two options, A and B.</p>
    <p>Think back to your experience as a test-taker: you should reply to a question, and you are asking for a hint at a cost.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In option A, you take the hint privately, this means that nobody will see that you took a hint.</li>
      <li>In option B, you take the hint in front of a helper. This means that the helper will know whether you took the hint or not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In either option, the hint is exactly the same and you decided to take the hint (there is no option of NOT taking the hint).</p>
    <p>Which option would you choose?</p>

    <b>FOR THE FOLLOWING CHOICES, YOU ARE MATCHED WITH: {{ wr }}</b>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
          <th>Option A</th>
          <th>Option B</th>
        </tr>
        {{ for field in form }}
            <tr>
                {{ for choice in field }}
                    <td>{{ choice.label }}
                    {{ choice }}</td>
                {{ endfor }}
            </tr>
        {{ endfor }}
    </table>
