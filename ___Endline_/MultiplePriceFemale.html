    <p>We will now ask you to choose repeatedly between two options, A and B.</p>
    <p>Think back to your experience as a test-taker: you have to answer one question and <u>you have the option to get a hint at a cost.</u></p>

        <ul>
          <li>In option A, you take the hint privately. This means that nobody will see that you took a hint.</li>
          <li>In option B, you take the hint in front of a helper. This means that the helper will know whether you took the hint or not.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>In either option, the <u>hint is exactly the same</u> and you decided to take the hint <u>(there is no option of NOT taking the hint)</u>.</p>
    <b><p>For each of the questions below, choose repeatedly between Options A and B.</p></b>
