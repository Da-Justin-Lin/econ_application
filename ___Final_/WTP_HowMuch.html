    <p>You have chosen helper {{ player.wtp_who }}</p>

    <p>Now you have to decide how much to pay to avoid that s/he finds out about your hints.</p>
    <p>You can pay any amount between 0 and 10 $.</p>

    <p>Once you decide how much to pay, we will randomly draw a number between 0 and 10.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the number drawn is equal or higher than the price you decided to pay,
      we will still communicate your hints to the helper you selected and you won’t need to pay anything.</li>
      <li>If the number drawn is lower than the price you decided to pay,
      we won’t communicate your hints to the helper you selected and the price will be deducted from your final payment. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let’s make an example. Let’s say you want to pay 5. If the number randomly drawn
    by the computer is higher than or equal to 5, we will communicate your hints to the
    helper and you won’t need to pay anything. If the number randomly drawn by the computer
    is lower than 5, we won’t communicate your hints to the helper and 5 will be deducted from your final payment. </p>

    <p>Now it’s your turn to decide:</p>
